* April 2021: Co-presenter
  * "Incorporating Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Biostatistics Courses"
  * Co-presenters: Dr. Scarlett Bellamy, Dr. Reneé Moore
  * In this WebENAR, I discussed my experience incorporating DEI into BIOS 500L, Statistical Methods I Lab. ENAR members can view the recording [by clicking here](https://www.enar.org/education/past-webinars.cfm)

* Nov. 2020: Organizer
  * Inaugural Virtual Research Symposium on Racial and Social Disparities, Inequities, and Injustice
  * In May 2020, I reached out to Dr. Amanda Marie James, Chief Diversity Officer & Associate Dean, Diversity, Inclusion and Community Engagement, with the idea of organizing a virtual research symposium on racial and social disparities, inequities, and injustice. With Dr. James and a team of students across the Laney Graduate School, we organized a day-long inaugural event featuring student and faculty panels and research presentations.

* Mar. 2020 - present: Founder & President, Emory ASA student chapter
  * I established the ASA student chapter at Emory, which has organized multiple events and seminars. We incorporate DEI and general professional development into these events. For example, our April 2021 seminar was on data visualization, which included a discussion of accessibility considerations.

* Aug. - Dec. 2020: Instructor, Statistical Methods I Lab
  * In collaboration with Dr. Reneé Moore and other lab instructors, I curated a list of DEI materials to include in the Statistical Methods I lab course, which is required for all MPH students in the Rollins School of Public Health. We engaged students in discussions in several topics at the intersection of DEI and biostatistics, including: the use of binary gender in data analysis, racial bias in predictive policing, and the ethics of statistical analysis.

* May 2020 - present: Student representative, Biostatistics DEI committee
  * In addition to raising student concerns related to DEI, I co-organized a "BIOS Brain Bowl" series of events to promote community and engagement in the department.

* Oct. 2019: Session chair and panelist, Working and Thriving with Disability in the Statistical Sciences
  * Women in Statistics and Data Science Conference
  * Co-panelists: Dr. Regina Nuzzo, Dr. Amy Willis, Dr. Anna Plantinga
  * We discussed our experiences as statisticians with disabilities and opened the floor to hear others' experiences as well.

* DEI-related training/coursework:
  * Engaging Students in the Teaching of Statistics
  * Teaching in Public Health
  * Harvard Summer Program in Biostatistics & Computational Biology
