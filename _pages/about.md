I am a 5th year PhD student in the [Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://www.sph.emory.edu/departments/bios/index.html) at Emory University. My dissertation advisor is [Dr. Hao Wu](http://www.haowulab.org/). We are currently working on novel statistical approaches to detect a mediation effect while accounting for a latent variable (e.g. cell type), with primary application to DNA methylation and gene expression data. 

I am currently collaborating with [Dr. Nina Guzzetta](https://www.pedsresearch.org/people/faculty/nina-guzzetta-md) (Children's Healthcare of Atlanta) and [Dr. Lisa Haddad](https://med.emory.edu/departments/gynecology-obstetrics/profile/?u=LBHADDA) (Emory School of Medicine). I have also pursued multiple teaching opportunities as a PhD student, including introductory SAS programming for Health Policy masters students and introductory statistics for undergraduate students. After I complete my PhD, I plan to pursue an academic position.

I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with bachelors degrees in biostatistics and mathematics and a minor in music. I worked with Dr. Nick Battista in Dr. Laura Miller's computational biology lab studying fluid dynamics in embryonic heart development. Through this work, I was introduced to the process of research and learned to code in Matlab.

In my free time, I enjoy playing instruments (primarily piano and ukulele), reading, and watching UNC basketball. I also volunteer for multiple disability advocacy organizations and am a local ambassador for the Georgia Muscular Dystrophy Association.
